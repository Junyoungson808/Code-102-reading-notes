# Class 7: Functions

Define a Function: A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (){}.

function NAMEFUNCTION(PARAMETERS){CODE TO BE EXECUTED};

function myFunction(p1,p2) { ,<-- Type of code to be executed
    return p1 * p2;
}

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

Definitions:
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function Return
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
